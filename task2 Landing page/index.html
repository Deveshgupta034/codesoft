              when we talk about rajasthan ( India) we imagine lots of sand , folk music and unique culture .
              but in cities its very difficult to find it naturally .
              but this is the place where u can find it very easily very decent people , pure Rajasthani culture , cool folk music and more over lots of sand spreads in miles.
              so i think its very economical and must visit place to see true Rajasthan.
              Jodhpur is a very popular tourist destination. The landscape is scenic and mesmerizing. Jodhpur city has many beautiful palaces and forts such as Mehrangarh Fort, Jaswant Thada, Umaid Bhavan Palace and Rai ka Bag Palace. Other charms of Jodhpur include Government museum and it's beautiful Umed garden. The city is known as the "Sun City" because of its bright and sunny weather throughout the year.

              In my view, travelling is the most wonderful experience of life. Recently, I visited Rajasthan for 15 days with my family . First we landed in Jaipur, which is popularly known as "Pink city". We stayed there for 3 days and visited many places like Jaipur fort, Jaipur Museum, Hawa Mahal etc. From there to Udaipur. This city is famous for buildings. We travelled by bus to reach our next destination i.e. Mout Abu, a hill station. The natural scenes were very beautiful in this place like lakes and sun set points etc.
